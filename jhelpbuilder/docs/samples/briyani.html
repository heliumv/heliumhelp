Biryani is a dish of layered rice and vegetarian mixture. The vegetarian mixture is based on potato.
<BR>
<div class="heading">Ingredients and Directions:</div> 
<ul>
 <li>2 onions</li>
 <li>1 clove garlic (or more, up to 5)</li>
 <li>1 T fresh ginger</li>
 <br><br>
 Saute in water until the onion is soft. Add:<br>
 <li>1/2 tsp chilli powder</li>
 <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
 <li>1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
 <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
 <li>1 tsp salt</li>
 <li>2 chopped tomatoes, fresh or canned</li>
 <br><br>
 Continue cooking briefly. Then add
 <br>
 <li>2 tsp yoghurt</li>
 <li>2 tsp chopped fresh mint</li>
 <li>1/2 tsp ground cardamom</li>
 <li>2 inch piece of cinnamon stick</li>
 and cook until it becomes a thick smooth paste.

</ul> 

<ul>
Meanwhile, cut potatoes in quarters or eights and bake on a flat sheet in the oven until fairly soft. The outsides should be golden. We use a toaster oven. Add to the mixture and simmer for up to an hour to let flavours mix.
<br><br>
 While the potatoes are simmering, make the rice.
 <li>1 onion</li>
 <li>5 cardamom pods</li>
 <li>2 whole cloves (or 1/8 tsp ground cloves)</li>
 <li>1 stick cinnamon</li>
 <li>2 tsp rose water</li>
 <li>1 1/2 tsp salt</li>
 <li>1 1/2 - 2 cups basmati or long grain white rice</li>
</ul>
 Chop onion and saute in water. Add spices and mix for a few seconds. Add
 rice and cook until opaque. Add twice as much water as you used rice,
 bring to the boil, then turn to minimum and leave covered for 12 mins.
 Remove cardamom pods and cinnamon stick, which will be sitting on 
 the top of the rice.
 <br>
 Now, put half the rice mixture on the bottom of a large oven-proof dish.
 Put the vegetarian mixture on top, then use the remaining rice mixture on
 top of it.  Heat in the oven to warm properly.
